# afe-cards
Cards-based personal notebook site for Advanced Front End class

This is built from a customized version of the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) [Responsive Design Template](http://www.initializr.com/).

It has had some modifications:

* Boilerplate content to start out a web development notebook with representative sections
* Addition of a _scss_ folder for local modifications
* Addition of a _local.scss_ file to begin customizations
* Some minor tweaks to the menu using scss

Your job is to make modifications as required by assignment two and later assignments, then to use this notebook as a means of recording what you've learned as part of this class.

# Iteration One
1. Design a “card” HTML & SCSS component that has the following characteristics (We will do this as a discussion in class)  
[ ] It must contain an image. You can use a placeholder image from placehold.it, a colored banner whose color relates to the overall topic (HTML, CSS, etc.), or an image that evokes the specific topic of the card.  
[ ] It must have a title that overlays the image/banner.  
[ ] It must have a summary that is always visible.  
[ ] It must have a description that only appears when requested. Note Material Design does not allow flipping, so review the specification to see what sort of animation is legal within the language.  
[ ] It must have at least one action that reveals the description.  
[ ] It may optionally have a second action that links to an authoritative site (like MDN or sass-lang) that explains the item in more detail.  
[ ] Make sure you use variables, @include, @mixins and @extends directives to implement your design.  
[ ] Create at least three cards with real content in each topic area (HTML, CSS, JS, Tools, Learning).
